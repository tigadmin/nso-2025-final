He developed our\n                        very first crappy one-page website back in 2008. Hey, that’s all I could afford at\n                        the time. Today our website has literally thousands of pages and is very complex. In\n                        fact, a website is a live being that always has to be tended to. Jason is in charge\n                        of our web developers, SEO (search engine optimization), PPC (pay per click) and SEM\n                        team (search engine optimization team). There is always work to do with a growing\n                        business. A strong brand has to stay on top of these web developments and Jason is\n                        always on it. He works from the office and from home and most weeks I wouldn’t be\n                        surprised if he puts in sixty hours a week. When there is a major website change, he\n                        will pull an all-nighter because that is when the least amount of traffic is on the\n                        site. He’s an incredibly smart guy and has a work ethic that rivals mine. He has\n                        been a huge asset to Heather, myself and the entire 9Round organization.”\n                    </v-card-text>\n                <div class=\"text-xs-center pa-5\" align=\"center\">\n                    <v-img alt=\"Local Search Ads\" max-width=\"180\" cover contain src=\"img/img/9round.png\">\n                    </v-img>\n                </div>\n                    <div class=\"flex subheading font-weight-light\">\n                        <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Zero-100-Building-Fitness-Locations/dp/149176547X\">Source:\n                            https://www.amazon.com/Zero-100-Building-Fitness-Locations/dp/149176547X\n                        </a>\n                    </div>\n            </v-card>\n        </v-layout>\n    </v-container>\n</section>\n",null]}
