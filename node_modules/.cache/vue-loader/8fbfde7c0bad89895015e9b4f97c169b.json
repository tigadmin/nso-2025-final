He\n          developed our very first crappy one-page website back in 2008. Hey,\n          that’s all I could afford at the time. Today our website has\n          literally thousands of pages and is very complex. In fact, a website\n          is a live being that always has to be tended to. Jason is in charge\n          of our web developers, SEO (search engine optimization), PPC (pay\n          per click) and SEM team (search engine optimization team). There is\n          always work to do with a growing business. A strong brand has to\n          stay on top of these web developments and Jason is always on it. He\n          works from the office and from home and most weeks I wouldn’t be\n          surprised if he puts in sixty hours a week. When there is a major\n          website change, he will pull an all-nighter because that is when the\n          least amount of traffic is on the site. He’s an incredibly smart guy\n          and has a work ethic that rivals mine. He has been a huge asset to\n          Heather, myself and the entire 9Round organization.”\n        </v-card-text>\n        <div class=\"text-xs-center pa-5\" align=\"center\">\n          <v-img\n            alt=\"Local Search Ads\"\n            max-width=\"180\"\n            cover\n            contain\n            src=\"img/img/9round.png\"\n          >\n          </v-img>\n        </div>\n      </v-card>\n    </v-layout>\n  </v-container>\n</section>\n",null]}
